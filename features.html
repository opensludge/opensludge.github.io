<h1>Features</h1>

<h2 id="current">Current Features</h2>


<p>SLUDGE currently contains built-in support for the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Objects</b> - with easy to use "events" defining how the game reacts when different objects are combined
</li><li><b>Characters</b> - plus automatic scaling (now with anti-aliasing as standard) and special effects such as transparency
</li><li><b>Animations</b> - suitable for one-shot <i>and</i> automatically looping animations; combine any images from a sprite bank in any order
</li><li><b>Costumes</b> - with a costume your characters can look 
different when facing different directions (any number of directions you want)...
 plus you can provide different animations for talking, walking and 
standing still
</li><li><b>Full-screen backgrounds</b> - load 'em from PNG or TGA files in a single line
</li><li><b>Interactive backgrounds</b> - yes, bits of the background image can represent objects too
</li><li><b>Sound effects</b> - play any noise (OGG or WAV) at any time 
with a single command; also support for looping sounds, changing the 
volume of individual noises and a whole heap of other audio goodness
</li><li><b>Music</b> - play up to three tunes at once (MOD, S3M, IT or XM)
</li><li><b>Full talkie versions</b> - just supply a sound file when you make someone talk or think, and SLUDGE takes care of everything for you
</li><li><b>Scrolling backgrounds</b> - point the camera anywhere at any time
</li><li><b>Freezing / unfreezing</b> - put the entire world on hold while you go to a close-up, look through your inventory or run your custom menu system
</li><li><b>Input handlers</b> - set the engine up so that it calls <i>your</i> function when a mouse button is clicked, when the mouse moves, when a key is pressed...
</li><li><b>Timers</b> - pause for however long you want, whenever you want, without your character saying "..."
</li><li><b>Multiple functions at once</b> - keep that character moving 
or talking in the background, animate waterfalls or just devise puzzles 
which must be solved against the clock
</li><li><b>Z-buffers</b> - so characters walk behind tables, trees, door-frames, alien machinery etc.
</li><li><b>Floor plans</b> - including automatic path finding without crossing non-walkable areas
</li><li><b>Lightmaps</b> - set up shadows and spotlights simply by using an extra image the same size as your room
</li><li><b>True-colour</b> - SLUDGE uses 32-bit colour throughout
</li><li><b>Any resolution you want</b> - provided your video card can support it, so can SLUDGE
</li><li><b>Windowed mode</b> - with your own custom title bar and quit message (whoo!)
</li><li><b>Full-screen mode</b> - and if full-screen mode fails, your game will run in windowed mode instead rather than just keeling over
</li><li><b>Game loading and saving</b> - plus rename, delete or launch any file you want
</li><li><b>Single output file</b> - containing all your graphics, sounds and script
</li><li><b>Scripts are compiled not interpreted</b> - nobody can break in and see how you did all your clever bits... and they run faster, too
</li><li><b>Shaded variable-width fonts</b> - fonts are just greyscale sprite banks, and if you don't like Hungry Software's demo font (based on Ariel) there are <a href="resources.html#fonts">plenty of other fonts to download</a> courtesy of other SLUDGE users
</li><li><b>Sprite flipping</b> - just use a negative sprite number and the appropriate sprite will be mirrored for you, saving you file space
</li><li><b>Compressed sprite files</b> - yep, your sprite banks are now compressed, saving you even <i>more</i> file space
</li><li><b>Per-pixel mouse-over-sprite checking</b> - the mouse will only register a character when you're actually pointing at it, <i>not</i> just anywhere within its bounding box
</li><li><b>Spinning characters</b> - on command <i>and</i> automatically when turning a corner while walking, at whatever speed you want
</li><li><b>Semi-automatic font conversion ("Fontify")</b> - courtessy of the new sprite bank editor
</li><li><b>Fantastic audio support</b> - not just your standard WAV 
files, but Ogg Vorbis and FLAC compressed samples and lots of track-based
 music formats (MOD, S3M, IT and XM)
</li><li><b>Improved keyboard handler</b> - catch more keypresses 
including function keys, cursor keys and - should you want to - Alt, 
Ctrl, Shift, Alt Gr, Caps Lock, Insert, Delete, Home, End, Page Up, Page
 Down, Windows and any extra quick-launch keys your keyboard may have
</li><li><b>Multiple transition modes</b> - Bored of your screens 
appearing and disappearing too quickly? Now you can disolve or fade in 
and out, or even cross fade between one scene and the next
</li><li><b>Your own choice of icon</b> - well, you can't change the 
icon for the SLUDGE engine, but here's the next best thing... give your 
project a 16x16 or 32x32 image and the engine will use it as an icon in 
your game's title bar, and in the taskbar while it's running
</li><li><b>Silent running</b> - no sound support? So what! The engine 
can now carry on regardless, letting people with no sound cards play 
your game too! It's also an easy way to make a much smaller file for 
a faster download for people with slow modems
</li><li><b>Portable custom data files</b> - save an array to a file for
 use later, or even use by another SLUDGE game... you can even encode it
 all so nobody else can understand it, and all you need to do to read it
 is provide the same key
</li><li><b>Background parallax scrolling</b> - leave holes in your room
 through which you can see a sky or background which scrolls at a 
different speed to the rest of the scene
</li><li><b>Multiple language support</b> - make your game playable in as many languages as you have the time to provide, all within the one game file</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="possibilities">Current Possibilities</h2>

<p>SLUDGE does <i>not</i> contain built-in support for the following, but all this stuff - and a whole lot more - <i>is entirely possible</i> using the language (and, therefore, a lot more customisable):</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Inventory system</b> - SLUDGE uses 
one array / stack / queue / linked-list type container which is ideally 
suited to implementing an inventory (source code in example project)
</li><li><b>Scrolling credits</b> - You can paste to the screen, and you can scroll the video buffer... what more do you need? (source code
<a href="resources.html#src-scrolling-credits">here</a>)
</li><li><b>Text entry boxes</b> - Freeze, write your message on the screen, unfreeze... and make it look exactly how you want (source code
<a href="resources.html#src-text-box">here</a>)
</li><li><b>Automatic character following</b> - just update the position of the camera every frame, and hey presto! (source code
<a href="resources.html#src-smooth-scrolling">here</a>)
</li><li><b>Fake foreground parallax scrolling</b> - a la Broken Sword... simply update the location of an inanimate "character" every time you move the camera
</li><li><b>Interactive conversations</b> - there's nothing in SLUDGE to
 handle this, but with such an impressive scripting language the code 
for a complete interactive conversation mechanism is less than 100 lines
 (source code in example project)
</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="iwant">I Want... I Want...</h2>

<p>More suggestions? Make them known on the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/http://www.adventuredevelopers.com/forum/index.php?topic=2276.0">SLUDGE wishlist forum thread</a>! You never know, your ideas may appear in a future version of SLUDGE!</p>
